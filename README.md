# Rodri Yeoman generator

My yeoman generator for react eslint (soon typescript and Nextjs)
Will add more in the future when needed

You will need to install `yo` Yeoman generator 

```sh
npm install -g yo
```

and then 

```sh
yo rodri:eslint
```

will prompt as list

```sh
"Which ESLint config do you want?"
> javascript
> next
> typescript
```
